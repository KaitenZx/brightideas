## üéØ Project Goal

This project was created with a dual purpose:

1.  **Build a useful tool:** Develop a functional platform for managing ideas.
2.  **Demonstrate Fullstack Skills:** Showcase my ability to design, develop, test, and deploy fullstack applications by mastering backend technologies, database interactions, API creation, CI/CD, logging, monitoring, and applying modern approaches and tools across the entire stack.

## üèõÔ∏è Architectural Decisions & Technical Highlights

*   **Monorepo (PNPM Workspaces):** Optimizes dependency management, ensures version consistency, and simplifies code reuse (`shared` package) and tooling setup.
*   **End-to-End Type Safety (TypeScript + tRPC):** A key advantage. Guarantees type consistency between backend, API, and frontend without code generation, significantly improving reliability and development speed.
*   **Prisma ORM:** A modern approach to database interaction in TypeScript. Provides type-safe queries, a simple migration system, and automatic type generation.
*   **Clean Backend Architecture:** API logic is separated by feature (`router`), infrastructure modules are isolated in `lib`, ensuring good Separation of Concerns (SoC). The router structure (`router/feature/action/index.ts` + `input.ts`) promotes scalability.
*   **Production-Ready Logging & Monitoring:** Configured Winston with sensitive data masking and structured log shipping to Datadog (for production). Sentry integration on both backend and frontend with source maps for efficient error debugging.
*   **Secure & Flexible Environment Management:** Use of `.env` files for different environments, strict Zod validation of variables at application startup. Implemented a secure mechanism to pass *only necessary* variables from backend to frontend (`window.webappEnvFromBackend`) without baking them into the bundle.
*   **Reliable File Uploads:** Support for two services (Cloudinary, AWS S3) using pre-signed URLs for secure direct-from-client uploads.
*   **Automated CI/CD:** Configured GitHub Actions workflow for building, testing (linting), and automatically deploying to Fly.io on pushes to `main`. Includes sending source maps to Sentry.
*   **High Code Quality & Automation:** Strict ESLint rules (including custom ones to enforce architecture, e.g., disallowing direct imports from `backend` to `webapp`), Prettier, Stylelint. Automatic rule enforcement via Git Hooks (Husky + lint-staged).
*   **Thoughtful Docker Build:** Multi-stage `Dockerfile` optimizes the final image size, utilizing build secrets and `pnpm` caching.
*   **Modern Frontend:** Uses Vite for fast development, React 18, code-splitting (`React.lazy`, `Suspense`) for load optimization, and SCSS Modules for style isolation.
*   **Testing Foundation:** Testing infrastructure based on Vitest, presence of backend integration tests with helper functions for data setup.
*   **Email Templating (MJML):** Using MJML allows for creating responsive and appealing HTML emails effortlessly.

## üöÄ How to Run Locally

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (v22+, see `package.json` engines)
*   PNPM (v10+, see `package.json`)
*   Docker & Docker Compose
*   Git

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/BrightIdeas.git
    cd BrightIdeas
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

3.  **Configure environment variables:**
    *   Copy `backend/env.example` to `backend/.env`.
    *   Copy `webapp/env.example` to `webapp/.env`.
    *   Carefully fill in the **mandatory** variables (`DATABASE_URL`, `JWT_SECRET`, `PASSWORD_SALT`).
    *   For full functionality, fill in API keys for Cloudinary, S3, Sentry, Datadog, Email. Locally, some can be left empty if their services are not critical for testing (check `zEnvNonemptyTrimmedRequiredOnNotLocal` in `backend/src/lib/env.ts`).

4.  **Start the PostgreSQL database:**
    ```bash
    docker compose up -d db
    ```

5.  **Apply Prisma migrations:**
    ```bash
    pnpm b pmd # Runs 'prisma migrate dev' in the backend workspace
    ```

6.  **Run both applications in development mode:**
    ```bash
    pnpm dev
    ```
    *   Backend: `http://localhost:3000` (or port from `backend/.env`)
    *   Frontend: `http://localhost:8000` (or port from `webapp/.env`)

### Running Tests

*   **Run all lint checks:**
    ```bash
    pnpm lint
    ```
*   **Run all tests (currently backend integration):**
    *   Ensure the test database (`DATABASE_URL` in `backend/.env.test`) is available and migrations are applied (`pnpm b pmt`).
    ```bash
    pnpm test
    ```
*   **Run backend tests only:**
    ```bash
    pnpm b test
    ```
*   **Run webapp tests only (if available):**
    ```bash
    pnpm w test
    ```

*   **Dockerfile:** Optimized multi-stage Dockerfile in the root directory.
*   **CI/CD Workflow:** `.github/workflows/fly-deploy.yml`.
*   **Required Fly.io Secrets (`fly secrets set NAME=VALUE`):**
    *   `DATABASE_URL` (production DB)
    *   `JWT_SECRET`, `PASSWORD_SALT`, `INITIAL_ADMIN_PASSWORD`

## üîÆ Potential Improvements & Areas for Growth

*   **Testing:** **Significantly increase test coverage**, especially for Frontend components and pages (using React Testing Library / Vitest). Add more unit tests for utilities in `backend` and `shared`.
*   **Features:**
    *   Add comments to ideas.
    *   Implement WebSockets (e.g., via `ws` or Socket.IO) for real-time updates.
    *   Enhance search capabilities (integrate with ElasticSearch/MeiliSearch).
    *   Add a tagging/category system for ideas.
    *   Expand the role model (editors, moderators).
*   **Optimization:** Analyze frontend bundle performance (`rollup-plugin-visualizer` is already set up). Optimize database queries if necessary.
